Somewhat disjointed technical explanation: the images are size 324x144 and tileable, which are then tiled to fill a 342x180 image (so that it encompasses 12 hexes; 6 horizontally and 2 vertically), of which hex-sized pieces are then cut via the ~MASK IPF and tiled next to each other so that the same 12-hex pattern is always preserved. The same method could be used for other kinds of terrains as well, with different sizes and tiling patterns.
